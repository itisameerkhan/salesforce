* Salesforce is a cloud company. Everything we offer resides in the trusted, multitenant cloud.

* The Salesforce platform is the foundation of our services. It‚Äôs powered by metadata and made up of different parts, like data services, artificial intelligence, and robust APIs for development.
* All our apps sit on top of the platform. Our prebuilt offerings like Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud Engagement, along with apps you build using the platform, have consistent, powerful functionality.
* Everything is integrated. Our platform technologies like predictive analytics and the development framework are built into everything we offer and everything you build.

> [!NOTE]
> There are a few terms in here that are extra important for you to understand: trust, multitenancy, metadata, and the API.

This idea is multitenancy. Multitenancy is a great word for making you sound smart at dinner parties, but really all it means is that you‚Äôre sharing resources. Salesforce provides a core set of services to all our customers in the multitenant cloud. No matter the size of your business, you get access to the same computing power, data storage, and core features.

Trust and multitenancy go hand in hand. Despite the fact that you‚Äôre sharing space with other companies, you can trust Salesforce to keep your data secure. You can also trust that you‚Äôre getting the latest and greatest features with automatic, seamless upgrades three times a year. Since Salesforce is a cloud service, you never have to install new features or worry about your hardware. All this is possible because of multitenancy.

## ‚≠ê The Magic of Metadata

**metadata is data about data.**

Metadata in the context of Salesforce refers to the structure and configuration of the Salesforce platform, including its objects, fields, workflows, layouts, permissions, and more. Unlike traditional software development where code defines the behavior and structure of an application, in Salesforce, metadata defines how the platform functions and behaves.

## ‚≠ê All About that API

**The application programming interface (API) allows different pieces of software to connect to each other and exchange information.**

## ‚≠ê Navigate setup

## ‚≠ê Lookup Relationship

* In Salesforce, a lookup relationship is a way to connect two objects together based on a common field.

* With a lookup relationship, one object (the child) has a reference (or lookup field) to another object (the parent).

* This allows you to establish a link between records of the child object and the parent object.

* In a lookup relationship, the child record can exist without a parent record, and the relationship is not required.

* Lookup relationships are typically used when there is a loose or optional connection between objects.

* For example, in a CRM system, you might have a lookup relationship between the "Contact" object and the "Account" object. Each contact can be associated with one account, but it's not mandatory for a contact to have an account.

## ‚≠ê Master Detail Relationship

* A master-detail relationship in Salesforce is a more tightly-coupled connection between two objects.

* With a master-detail relationship, one object (the detail) is dependent on another object (the master).

* The master object controls certain behaviors of the detail object, such as record ownership and deletion behavior.

* In a master-detail relationship, the detail record cannot exist without a corresponding master record.

* Master-detail relationships are typically used when there is a strict and mandatory relationship between objects.

* For example, in a project management system, you might have a master-detail relationship between the "Project" object and the "Task" object. Each task belongs to exactly one project, and if the project is deleted, all associated tasks are also deleted.
